Innovation with VTK.'' 

We thank the maintainers of the OsiriX DICOM Image
Library~\citep{osirix_osirix_2017} for providing the head (used
in~\Autoref{fig:clipping}) and torso (used in~\Autoref{fig:rendertotexture,
fig:blendingmodes, fig:gradient}) datasets used in this publication. The
Supernova (used for ~\Autoref{fig:supernova}) and Turbulent-Combustion (used
for~\Autoref{fig:application-areas}) datasets were obtained from
VisFiles~\citep{visfiles_visfiles_2007}. The supernova dataset is made available
by John Blondin at the North Carolina State University through US Department
of Energy's SciDAC Institute for Ultrascale Visualization. The turbulent
combustion dataset is made available by Jackqueline Chen at Sandia
Laboratories through US Department of Energy's SciDAC Institute for Ultrascale
Visualization. We would also like to thank Jianwei (John) Miao from University
of California at Los Angeles and Robert Hovden from Cornell University for
granting us permission to use the~\ce{PtCu} (used in~\Autoref{fig:ptcu-grad})
nanoparticle dataset. The
cactus sample dataset (used in~\Autoref{fig:jittering}) is courtesy of Michael
Holland and Dula Parkinson from Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory.

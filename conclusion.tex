\section{Future Work}
\label{future-work}
As a result of this work, we have developed a replacement class for
vtkGPURayCastMapper that is more widely supported, faster, more easily
extensible, and supports majority of the features of the old class. In the
near future, our goal is to ensure that this mapper works as promised by
integrating it into existing VTK applications such as ParaView and 3D Slicer.
Once this integration and proofing process is complete, we plan on adding
additional, advanced features as described in the following.

\subsection{2D Transfer Functions}
\label{2d-transfer-functions}
Currently, volume rendering in VTK uses three independent 1D transfer functions
to map scalar value to color, scalar value to opacity and gradient magnitude to
opacity. Increasing the number of parameters in a transfer function can improve
discrimination between structures in the volume data given that the combined
parametric information allows to disambiguate areas that fall within a given range
of those parameters simultaneously. Enhanced structure discrimination is beneficial
in medical image visualization where distinct tissues are approximately constant
in value and values transition smoothly from one tissue to the next. There is ongoing
work to support 2D transfer functions combining scalar value and gradient magnitude
(the scalar field variable and its first derivative) under the the DOE Office of
Science contract DE-SC0011385 grant.

\subsection{Overlapping Volumes}
\label{overlapping-volumes}
It is currently possible to render overlapping volumes by taking advantage of
the up to four independent components supported by the mapper (each component
representing a different volume).
The limitation of this approach is that each of the overlapping volumes are
required to be sampled in the same grid, hence all of the volumes are required
to share the same dimensions.  Nonetheless, in order to extend the mapper to
support overlapping volumes sampled in grids with different dimensions, rays
can be cast through proxy geometry bounding the N overlapping volumes to be
rendered and separately sampling and compositing their fetched texture values in
the fragment shader.

\subsection{Improved Rendering of Labeled Data}
\label{improved-rendering-of-labeled-data}
Currently, VTK supports binary masks and only a couple of specific representations
of label mapping. We know that our community needs more extensive label mapping
functionality--especially for medical datasets. Labeled data requires careful
attention to the interpolation method used for various parameters. (Users may wish
to use linear interpolation for the scalar value to look up opacity, but select 
the nearest label to look up the color.) We
plan to solicit feedback from the VTK community to understand the sources of
labeled data and the application requirements for visualization of such data. We
then hope to implement more comprehensive labeled data volume rendering for both
the CPU and GPU mappers.

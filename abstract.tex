\abstract{
The Visualization Toolkit (VTK)~\cite{vtk} is a popular open source toolkit for
scientific and medical data visualization which supports a wide variety of
data formats, processing filters and rendering of both polygonal and
volumetric data.  The volume rendering module provides features such as plane
clipping, color and opacity transfer functions, lighting and other controls
needed for visualization.  However, due to VTK's legacy OpenGL backend
reliance on a deprecated API, volume rendering would fail to take advantage of
the latest improvements in graphics hardware and the flexibility of a
programmable pipeline.  Additionally, this dependence on an antiquated
pipeline would pose a restriction on its reliability when running on recent
target platforms and would limit its scope.   Hence we developed a new and
improved volume rendering module for VTK's OpenGL2 backend, which also
augmented the GPU-based implementation with features such as fast volume
clipping, gradient opacity, and hardware-based volume picking.

The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is a popular cross-platform, open source
toolkit for scientific and medical data visualization, processing and
analysis. It supports a wide variety of data formats, algorithms and rendering
techniques for both polygonal and volumetric data. In particular VTK's volume
rendering module has long provided a comprehensive set of features such as
plane clipping, color and opacity transfer functions, lighting and other
controls needed for visualization. However, due to VTK's legacy OpenGL backend
and its reliance on a deprecated API, the system did not take advantage of the
latest improvements in graphics hardware and the flexibility of a programmable
pipeline. Additionally, this dependence on an antiquated pipeline posed
restrictions when running on emerging computing platforms thereby limited its
overall applicability. In response to these limitations, the VTK community
developed a new and improved volume rendering module, which not only produced
a modern GPU-based implementation, but augmented capabilities with new
features such as fast volume clipping, gradient magnitude based opacity
modulation, render to texture and hardware-based volume picking.

The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is a popular cross-platform, open source toolkit
for scientific and medical data visualization, processing and analysis. It
provides a wide variety of data formats, algorithms and rendering of both
polygonal and volumetric data. VTK's volume rendering module boasts a
comprehensive set of features such as plane clipping, color and opacity transfer
functions, lighting and other controls needed for visualization. However, due to
VTK's legacy OpenGL backend and its reliance on a deprecated API, volume
rendering would fail to take advantage of the latest improvements in graphics
hardware and the flexibility of a programmable pipeline. Additionally, this
dependence on an antiquated pipeline would pose a restriction on its reliability
when running on recent target platforms and limit its scope. We developed a new
and improved volume rendering module for VTK's OpenGL2 backend, which also
augments the GPU-based implementation with features such as fast volume
clipping, gradient magnitude based opacity modulation, render to texture and
hardware-based volume picking.
